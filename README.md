# WheelOfFortune
This is an exercise in creating a wheel of fortune game in python that can be played by 3 players.

Detailed instructions for gameplay are found in the instructions.txt file.

The words used in the game are found in animals.txt. This file must be downloaded and placed in the same directory as wheel-of-fortune.py in order to function properly. Other files may be substituted for more dynamic gameplay. However, the file should be in .txt format and each word should be separated by a newline to maintain functionality. The theme will also need to be updated, as it is currently hardcoded as 'Animals.'

animals.txt (or another .txt word file) and wheel-of-fortune.py are the only files needed to play this game of Wheel of Fortune. 

Enjoy!
